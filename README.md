# About the App:

- **Easy Todo** is a simple and elegant web application that allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks in a user-friendly interface.
- You can also mark your tasks as completed or incomplete, and filter them by their status or keywords.
- The app uses **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing, **JSON Server** for mocking a RESTful API, and **Tailwind CSS** and **Daisy UI** for styling and UI components.
- The app also uses **React Icons** for adding icons to the tasks and buttons, and **UUID** for generating unique IDs for each task.
- The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
